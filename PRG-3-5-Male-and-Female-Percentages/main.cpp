//  Write a program that asks the user for the number of males and the number of females
//  registered in a class. The program should display the percentage of males and females
//  in the class.
//  Hint: Suppose there are 8 males and 12 females in a class. There are 20 students in the
//  class. The percentage of males can be calculated as 8 / 20 = 0.4, or 40 percent. The
//  percentage of females can be calculated as 12 / 20 = .6, or 60 percent.
